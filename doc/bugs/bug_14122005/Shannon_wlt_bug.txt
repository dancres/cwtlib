    Complex Shannon Wavelet
 
    Definition: a complex Shannon wavelet is
            shan(x) = Fb^{0.5}*sinc(Fb*x)*exp(2*i*pi*Fc*x)
    depending on two parameters:
            Fb is a bandwidth parameter
            Fc is a wavelet center frequency
 
(!) The condition Fc > Fb/2 is sufficient to ensure that
(!) zero is not in the frequency support interval.
