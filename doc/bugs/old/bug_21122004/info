! with given main.c (cwtmod) on scales 16 or 17 exist some problems.
  On this scales exists strange, very big values.

- May be problem is with mapping to wavelet table values.

? Also discovered edges when precision switches (in cwto3).

------------------------
Bug in CWTMod! caused by killed 1.0 when computing rows num!!!


- Add choosable precision (float_t = float/double) ??
